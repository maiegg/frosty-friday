Here is the stream definition the challenge asks for:
```
create or replace stream wk38stream
on view employee_sales;
```

Then, to read into a table that (hopefully!) will track live updates, I add to a view: 
```
create or replace view wk38deletes as 
select * 
from wk38stream
where METADATA$ACTION = 'DELETE';
```
Simple enough. I tested a few different ways:
+ INSERT into `sales` 
+ DELETE inserted row 
+ DELETE previously existing row 

All are tracked and picked up by **both** the stream and the view.
