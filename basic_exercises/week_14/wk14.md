This one truly is basic. There is a built-in function for turning rows into JSON:

```

select OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
    'superhero_name b', superhero_name,
    'country_of_residence', country_of_residence,
    'notable_exploits', notable_exploits,
    'superpower', superpower,
    'second_superpower', second_superpower,
    'third_superpower', third_superpower
) as superhero_json
from week_14
```
