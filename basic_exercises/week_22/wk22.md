**Secure views and row-level security**

The trick to enforcing row-level security is including the role (probably other attributes are enforceable too) in a WHERE clause in the view query:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE SECURE VIEW exercises.frosty_friday.secure_cities AS
SELECT
    uuid_string() AS id,
    city, 
    district
FROM
    exercises.frosty_friday.week22 
WHERE
    (
        MOD(id, 2) = 1 AND CURRENT_ROLE() = 'REP1'
    )
    OR
    (
        MOD(id, 2) = 0 AND CURRENT_ROLE() = 'REP2'
    );
```

Besides that, the only other obstacle I encountered was ensuring that the roles can access a compute warehouse if you want to actually test querying the table:
```
-- And usage of warehouse! this was omitted in template 
use role accountadmin;
grant usage on warehouse compute_wh to role rep1;
grant usage on warehouse compute_wh to role rep2;
```
