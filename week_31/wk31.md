One-liner, but nice to remember to sometimes avoid explicitly writing out a window function:

```
  select min_by(hero_name, villains_defeated) as worst_hero
  , max_by(hero_name, villains_defeated) as best_hero
  from w31;
```
vs.
```
select *
from (
    select hero_name as best_hero
    from w31 
    qualify row_number() over (order by villains_defeated desc) = 1
) best 
left join (
select hero_name as worst_hero
from w31 
qualify row_number() over (order by villains_defeated asc) = 1
)
where 1=1;
```
