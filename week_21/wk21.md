This one is pretty basic, assuming you know the input table is well-behaved. 

It can be solved with a simple case statement:
```
    select hero_name
    , case
        when flight = '++' then 'flight' 
        when laser_eyes = '++' then 'laser_eyes'
        when invisibility = '++' then 'invisibillity'
        when invincibility = '++' then 'invincibility'
        when psychic = '++' then 'psychic'
        when magic = '++' then 'magic'
        when super_speed = '++' then 'super_speed'
        when super_strength = '++' then 'super_strength'
        else null
        end as main_superpower
    , case
        when flight = '+' then 'flight' 
        when laser_eyes = '+' then 'laser_eyes'
        when invisibility = '+' then 'invisibility'
        when invincibility = '+' then 'invincibility'
        when psychic = '+' then 'psychic'
        when magic = '+' then 'magic'
        when super_speed = '+' then 'super_speed'
        when super_strength = '+' then 'super_strength'
        else null
        end as secondary_superpower
    from hero_powers
```

If you didn't know that each row had no more than 1 superpower each marked `++` and `+`, this would be mpore complicated as this approach would only register the first column encountered with that marking in left-to-right order. This approach also picks up the null case of "Mister Unarmed Genius", who has no superpowers, but the instruction doesn't specify this needs to be excluded, and he can be filtered out when querying.
